AARAKSHAN:AN ALL IN ONE APP is developed using c++ and we have implemented the concepts of oops,maps,vectors and data file handling it .
We have also used the standard library functions.It is a menu driven program.This program is developed to overcome the existing system which had some flaws.It is developed to ease the work of the managing team as well as the user.It saves a lot of the time of the managing team as well as the user.The existing system of booking was a manual system in which there were a lot of chances of errors to occur so to overcome these issues this program is very helpful.
It provides the customer with the following services:-

i)room booking
ii)transportation booking
iii)food booking
iv)entertainment booking

Each of the above services contain sub contains sub menu.So that the customer is provided with a lot of options to choose from.The customer is also allowed to select multiple options according to his/her need.To implement the various options under the room,transportation,food and entertainment services we have used map because it is a key value pair.We have used rand() function to generate room numbers and number plates of the vehicles in the transportation class.

Finally the user is allowed to enter the mode of payment according to his/her convenience(by cash or by card)and a bill with all the necessary information gets printed on the screen.

Simultaneously, we have stored the total amount to be paid in text file using data file handling so it can be used in future purposes too.

We have implemented Data abstraction,Data encapsulation,Inheritance using classes.We have also included modularity by creating modules or functions in the program.
